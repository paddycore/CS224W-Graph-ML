## 👨‍💻 About Me (The "Local" Engineer)

Hi, I'm **Patrick** (@paddycore).
I'm a Computer Engineering student exploring the frontier of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**.

This repo is my "Digital Lab" where I experiment with:
* Graph Representation Learning
* GCNs, GraphSAGE, GATs
* Recommender Systems

## 📅 Progress Tracker

I treat this course like a research project. Here is my current status:

| Assignment | Topic | Status | Key Concepts |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Colab 0** | NetworkX & PyG Basics | ✅ Done | Graph manipulation, Tensors |
| **Colab 1** | Node Embeddings | 🚧 Doing | Shallow Encoders, Node2Vec |
| **Colab 2** | GNNs (GCN, GraphSAGE) | ⬜ Todo | Message Passing, Aggregation |
| **Colab 3** | Graph Attention (GAT) | ⬜ Todo | Attention Mechanism |
| **Colab 4** | Graph Prediction | ⬜ Todo | Link Prediction, Subgraphs |
| **Colab 5** | Heterogeneous Graphs | ⬜ Todo | HeteroGNNs, Meta-paths |

## 🚀 Capstone Project: [Title TBD]

*Planning Phase*
> **Objective:** Apply GNNs to a real-world dataset (focusing on local Thai context or e-commerce data).
>
> * **Dataset:** TBD (Considering Thai Transport Network or Social Graph)
> * **Model:** TBD
> * **Goal:** Build a working prototype/demo.
